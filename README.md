# project-Admin-Dashboared

The main purpose of this project is to practice grid layout. The page is not fullly responsive for phone but at least it displays well on desktop's resolutions.

The page uses the grid and flex property to make it "responsive". Before I do the project, I thought it will be easy but it turned out that it took me a week to make the page look like the [project design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/html_css/grid-lessons/project-dashboard/dashboard-project.png). Some overflows happened  unexpectedly and there are a lot of things about grid and flex that I learned and need to learn in the future.
